Program has a segmentation fault on line 6 when it attemps to access unalloacted memrory
So first we have to set break points to stop execution of control and then check for values.
For 10 values, program runs decently. (Becasue buf[10] variable has 10 bytes to store.)
When this count increases, then a segmentation error occureed.
CHAGES:
	- At line 6 just revome the 100 size to 10 or "sizeof(buf)"
STEPS

	~ gcc -g -c Task03.c
	~ gcc Task03.o
	~ gdb a.out
	~ b 6 if vr>10
