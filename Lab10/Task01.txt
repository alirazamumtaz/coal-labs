1. We can pass command line arguments in runtime by two ways:
	- set args arg1 arg2 ..
	- run arg1 arg2 ..

2. We can set break point by specifing condition:
	break "lineNo" if "condition"
i.e	break 7 if ch=','		// break executon at line 7 if
					// ch has ch is equal to comma ','

3.  We will use "next" command to execute next instruction of a c code
    but it will not godeep in other library functions

4. We will use "step" to get deep dive into to the function call.
	- step			/* to execute single line of code (like next),
				 * but if there is any function call, it'll deep
			 	 * dive into the function and execute the
			 	 * function's instructions one by one.
				 */

5. There are 3 different ways of continuing program after breakpoint:
	- continue		// to continue till next breakpoint

6. We'll use the following command:
	- finish	// to continue till return or end of current function
7. We'll use "print" command with respective variable name to see it's value.
	- print rv		// variable in program
	- print $temp		// gbd's temorary variabls

8. We use "display" command to print the a variable after every next step
	- display "variableName"
i.e 	- display vr		// show content of vr

9. We use "info locals" command to print a list of all the variables
   of current function whlile program is running.
	- info locals

10. We can displaye names of all functions used in uder debgging program by using:
	- info functions	// it will display functions in our prgram and also NON-Debugging symbols
